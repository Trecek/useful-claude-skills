# Slop Identification Skill

Identify and catalog AI-generated code slop in the codebase. Slop is useless code patterns left behind by AI assistants during rapid development - comments that won't make sense to future readers, backward compatibility hacks, dead code, and other technical debt.

## When to Use

- User says "id slop", "identify slop", "find slop"
- User wants "code cleanup" or "cleanup scan"
- User mentions "AI-generated junk" or "leftover comments"
- User asks to "find useless comments" or "remove dead code"

## Critical Constraints

**NEVER:**
- Modify any source code files (this skill only IDENTIFIES slop)
- Remove code without creating a removal plan first
- Flag legitimate comments, documentation, or architectural patterns
- Flag TODO comments that describe actual future work

**ALWAYS:**
- Use subagents for parallel exploration
- Write the slop removal plan to `temp/id-slop/` directory
- Provide file paths and line numbers for each finding
- Run dry walkthrough on the generated plan
- Categorize slop by type for prioritized removal

## Slop Categories

### Category 1: Phase Reference Comments (HIGH PRIORITY)
Comments mentioning numbered phases from AI implementation plans that won't make sense to future readers.

**Patterns to detect:**
- `Phase [0-9]` in comments or docstrings
- `# Phase 1:`, `# Phase 2:`, etc.
- References to "implementation phase" or "migration phase" with numbers
- `Part of Phase X` comments

**Example slop:**
```python
# Phase 5: Migrate Checkpoint and Session Management
def migrate_session():  # Part of Phase 2 migration
```

### Category 2: Backward Compatibility Hacks (HIGH PRIORITY)
Parameters or code kept solely for "API compatibility" that's no longer needed.

**Patterns to detect:**
- `kept for API compatibility`
- `kept for backward compatibility`
- `unused but kept for`
- `ignored - kept for`
- Parameters that are documented as "unused" or "ignored"

**Example slop:**
```python
use_file_lock: bool = True,  # Ignored - kept for API compatibility
log_dir: Optional[Path] = None,  # Ignored - kept for API compatibility
```

### Category 3: Removed Code Comments (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
Comments explaining what was removed without explaining what replaced it.

**Patterns to detect:**
- `removed in Phase`
- `no longer needed`
- `NOTE: X removed`
- References to deleted features or functions

**Example slop:**
```python
# NOTE: test-and-log removed in Phase 4. Use simple 'test' task.
# baseline_manager removed - now handled by executor
```

### Category 4: Deprecation Notices (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
Comments marking code as deprecated without removal timeline or replacement guidance.

**Patterns to detect:**
- `deprecated` without clear migration path
- `@deprecated` decorators on live code
- `will be removed` without version/date
- Stale deprecation warnings

### Category 5: Fallback/Workaround Code (HIGH PRIORITY)
Fallback logic that masks errors instead of failing fast.

**Patterns to detect:**
- `try: ... except: pass` blocks that swallow all exceptions
- `# Silently ignore` comments
- Fallback methods that don't log the original error
- `ignore_errors=True` without logging

**Example slop:**
```python
try:
    result = risky_operation()
except:
    pass  # Silently ignore errors
```

### Category 6: Type System Bypasses (LOW PRIORITY)
Comments that bypass type checking instead of fixing the actual type issue.

**Patterns to detect:**
- `# type: ignore` without explanation
- `# noqa` without specific error code
- `cast()` calls that don't make type sense

**Example slop:**
```python
entry.status = status  # type: ignore
return wrapper  # type: ignore
```

### Category 7: Dead Placeholder Code (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
Stub implementations, placeholder nodes, or scaffolding never replaced.

**Patterns to detect:**
- Functions with only `pass` or `...` bodies
- `placeholder` or `stub` in function names
- `# TODO: implement` without implementation
- Test scaffolding left in production code

**Example slop:**
```python
def find_next_placeholder(state):
    """Placeholder node for testing."""
    pass
```

### Category 8: Unreachable Code Comments (LOW PRIORITY)
Comments explaining why code is unreachable or can't happen.

**Patterns to detect:**
- `# This should be unreachable`
- `# Acknowledge unused parameter`
- `# satisfies mypy` for dead code paths
- Defensive code for impossible states

**Example slop:**
```python
# This should be unreachable if retry_attempts > 0, but satisfies mypy
raise RuntimeError("Unreachable")
```

### Category 9: Commented-Out Code (HIGH PRIORITY)
Code blocks that are commented out instead of deleted.

**Patterns to detect:**
- Multi-line commented code blocks
- `# old_function()` style commented calls
- `# return old_value` commented returns

### Category 10: Dead Code (HIGH PRIORITY)
Unused functions, classes, methods, imports, variables, and constants that are never referenced anywhere in the codebase.

**Patterns to detect:**
- Functions/methods with no callers
- Classes never instantiated or subclassed
- Imports not used in the module
- Variables/constants assigned but never read
- Module-level code that serves no purpose

## Investigation Workflow

### Step 1: Launch Parallel Subagents

Spawn 4-6 Explore subagents to scan different slop categories simultaneously:

```
Subagent 1: Phase References & Deprecation
- Search for "Phase [0-9]" patterns in comments
- Search for "deprecated" markers
- Search for "removed in" comments

Subagent 2: Backward Compatibility & Fallbacks
- Search for "kept for" compatibility patterns
- Search for "ignored" parameters
- Search for silent error handling

Subagent 3: Dead Code & Placeholders
- Search for placeholder/stub functions
- Search for unused imports with noqa
- Search for pass-only function bodies

Subagent 4: Type Bypasses & Unreachable Code
- Search for "type: ignore" without explanation
- Search for "noqa" suppressions
- Search for "unreachable" comments

Subagent 5: Commented-Out Code
- Search for multi-line comment blocks that look like code
- Search for commented function calls
- Search for # old_ patterns

Subagent 6: Dead Code
- Search for functions/classes with no callers
- Search for unused imports
- Search for assigned-but-never-read variables
```

### Step 2: Consolidate Findings

After subagents complete, organize findings by:
1. **File path**
2. **Line number(s)**
3. **Slop category**
4. **Priority** (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
5. **Removal action** (delete line, delete block, refactor)

### Step 3: Generate Removal Plan

Write a structured removal plan to: `temp/id-slop/slop_removal_plan.md`

The plan should follow this format:

```markdown
# Slop Removal Plan

**Date:** {YYYY-MM-DD}
**Scope:** {directories scanned}
**Total Findings:** {count}

## Summary by Category

| Category | Count | Priority |
|----------|-------|----------|
| Phase References | X | HIGH |
| Backward Compatibility | X | HIGH |
| ... | ... | ... |

## Phase 1: High Priority - Phase Reference Comments

### Objective
Remove all phase reference comments that won't make sense to future readers.

### Files to Modify

- `path/to/file.py:LINE`: Remove comment "# Phase 5: ..."
- `path/to/file.py:LINE-LINE`: Remove docstring section mentioning phases

### Implementation Steps
1. Delete line X in file.py containing "Phase 5" comment
2. Delete lines X-Y in file2.py containing phase docstring
...

### Success Criteria
- [ ] No "Phase [0-9]" patterns remain in comments
- [ ] Code still functions correctly

### Verification
```bash
grep -rn "Phase [0-9]" src/ --include="*.py" | grep -v "test"
```

## Phase 2: High Priority - Backward Compatibility Hacks

### Objective
Remove unused parameters kept for backward compatibility.

### Files to Modify
...

## Phase N: Final Verification

### Verification Commands
```bash
# Run linting/formatting checks and full test suite
```

### Success Criteria
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] No linting errors
- [ ] No functional regressions
```

### Step 4: Run Dry Walkthrough

After generating the removal plan, invoke the dry walkthrough skill:

```
Now running dry walkthrough on the slop removal plan...
```

### Step 5: Report Summary

Output to terminal:

```

### Next Steps
1. Review the plan at temp/slop_removal_plan.md
2. Dry walkthrough has been run - check for any issues
3. Implement the plan phase by phase
```

## Search Patterns Reference

Use these regex patterns for searching:

```bash
# Phase references
grep -rn "Phase [0-9]" --include="*.py"
grep -rn "# Phase" --include="*.py"

# Backward compatibility
grep -rn "kept for.*compatibility" --include="*.py"
grep -rn "ignored.*kept for" --include="*.py"

# Removed code
grep -rn "removed in Phase" --include="*.py"
grep -rn "no longer needed" --include="*.py"

# Fallbacks
grep -rn "except:.*pass" --include="*.py"
grep -rn "ignore_errors=True" --include="*.py"
grep -rn "Silently ignore" --include="*.py"

# Type bypasses
grep -rn "# type: ignore$" --include="*.py"
grep -rn "# noqa$" --include="*.py"

# Placeholders
grep -rn "placeholder" --include="*.py"
grep -rn "def.*stub" --include="*.py"

# Unreachable
grep -rn "should be unreachable" --include="*.py"
grep -rn "satisfies mypy" --include="*.py"
```

## Exclusions

Do NOT flag as slop:

1. **Architecture documentation** - Comments explaining design decisions
2. **API documentation** - Docstrings explaining parameters and return values
3. **Legitimate TODOs** - TODOs with clear descriptions of future work
4. **Test-specific code** - Mocks, fixtures, and test utilities
5. **Intentional type ignores** - Type ignores with explanatory comments
6. **Error handling with logging** - Exception handlers that log errors
7. **Feature flags** - Conditional code controlled by configuration
