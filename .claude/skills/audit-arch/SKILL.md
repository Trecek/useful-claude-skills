# Architectural Audit Skill

Audit the codebase for adherence to architectural standards and rules.

## When to Use

- User says "audit arch", "audit architecture", "check architecture"

## Critical Constraints

**NEVER:**
- Modify any source code files
- Update an existing report - always generate new

**ALWAYS:**
- Use subagents for parallel exploration
- Write report to `temp/audit-arch/arch_audit_{YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS}.md`
- Provide file paths and line numbers
- Categorize by severity (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)

---

## Architectural Principles

### Principle 1: Single Source of Truth

**Rule:** All state reads must come from the authoritative source (database, API, configuration management). File outputs and caches are write-only. Systems never read files back as the primary source of state.

**Audit Strategy - Data Flow Tracing:**

1. **Find all file read operations** in core application code

2. **For each read, trace the data flow:**
   - What data is being read?
   - Does it influence system behavior or state?

3. **Identify the PRIMARY source:**
   - If file is read first and authoritative source synced afterward, file is PRIMARY (CRITICAL violation)
   - If authoritative source is read first, authoritative source is PRIMARY (compliant)

4. **Check write/read symmetry:**
   - Find artifact writes, check for corresponding reads
   - If system reads back what it wrote, that's a violation

**Key Questions:**
- "If this file didn't exist, would the system fail or query the authoritative source?"
- "Does the order of operations show file-first or authoritative-source-first?"

**Critical:** Apply this to ALL state loading code paths. Any component that restores or reconstructs system state must be examined. File-first with authoritative source sync afterward is still file-primary.

**Cross-Reference:** If you discover file-first patterns while auditing other principles, report them here as P1 violations, not just as inconsistencies.

### Principle 2: Domain-Based Organization

**Rule:** Clear separation between domains with consistent structure.

**Common patterns:**
- Core domain logic separated from infrastructure
- Clear boundaries between business logic, data access, presentation
- Shared utilities in well-defined locations
- No mixing of concerns (e.g., CLI logic in database layer)

**Audit Strategy:**
- Check for misplaced components (utilities at root, API code in data layer)
- Find orphaned/empty directories from incomplete migrations
- Identify duplicates across locations
- Verify domain boundaries are respected

---

### Principle 3: Dependency Layering

**Rule:** Dependencies flow one direction. Higher layers depend on lower layers, never reverse.

**Typical layering:**
```
presentation/  -> depends on business logic, data access
business logic -> depends on data access, infrastructure
data access    -> depends on infrastructure only
infrastructure -> depends on nothing project-specific
```

**Also check internal layering:** Within a domain, core modules should not import from higher-level modules (handlers, controllers, UI).

**Audit Strategy:**
- Scan imports in each layer for boundary violations
- Look for deferred imports (indicate architectural debt)
- Check that foundational layers don't depend on higher layers
- Verify circular dependencies don't exist

---

### Principle 4: No Cross-Domain Imports

**Rule:** Separate domains/modules must be independent. Feature A cannot import from Feature B directly.

**Audit Strategy:**
- Scan each domain for imports from other domains at the same layer
- Shared functionality should be in common utilities or lower layers
- Check for tight coupling between features

---

### Principle 5: Architecture Pattern Consistency

**Rule:** When using architectural patterns (MVC, repository pattern, state machines, etc.), implementations must follow consistent patterns across the codebase.

**Audit Strategy:**
- Identify the architectural patterns in use
- Compare implementations across different modules
- Check if patterns diverge - is it intentional or inconsistency?
- Look for pattern violations (e.g., bypassing the repository layer)

**Important:** If a component bypasses the established pattern to use file-first state loading, that's a P1 violation - report it under P1, not here.

---

### Principle 6: No Code Duplication

**Rule:** Shared functionality exists in exactly one location.

**Audit Strategy:**
- Find functions/classes with same name in multiple locations
- Check migration pairs: old location should only re-export, not duplicate
- Look for copy-pasted code blocks with slight variations
- Identify logic that could be extracted to shared utilities

**Migration Awareness:** During migration, shims are acceptable only if they re-export from new location. Full duplicate implementations are violations.

---

### Principle 7: Data Access Pattern Compliance

**Rule:** All data access through designated abstraction layer (repositories, DAOs, services), never direct client usage in business logic.

**Audit Strategy:**
- Find direct database/API client usage outside designated data access layer
- Check for direct imports of database drivers, HTTP clients in business logic
- Verify all queries go through the abstraction layer

---

### Principle 8: No Monolithic Files

**Rule:** No file should exceed 1000 lines. Large files should be decomposed.

**Audit Strategy:**
- Find files exceeding 1000 lines (exclude generated/vendored)
- Flag files approaching threshold (800+ lines) as warnings

---

### Principle 9: Model Construction Integrity

**Rule:** When constructing models/objects from dicts/external data, use factory methods or full validation. Never manually select fields in constructor calls.

**Rationale:** Manual field selection silently drops unlisted fields. Optional fields are especially vulnerable since missing them causes no validation error.

**Audit Strategy:**
- Find `Model(field1=dict["x"], field2=dict.get("y"))` patterns
- Check if all source dict fields are mapped to target model
- Verify factory methods exist for cross-schema transformations
- Look for validation being skipped

**Severity:** HIGH - silent data loss breaks downstream consumers

---

### Principle 10: External Interface Compliance

**Rule:** Classes extending external framework base classes must implement ALL interface methods explicitly. Avoid mixin patterns where method resolution order affects behavior.

**Audit Strategy:**
- Find classes extending external bases (framework classes, third-party libraries)
- Check mixin ordering: mixins should come BEFORE the base class they augment
- Verify both sync AND async methods work (not inherited `NotImplementedError` stubs)
- Confirm contract tests exist for external interface compliance

**Severity:** CRITICAL - Interface mismatches only surface at runtime in specific code paths

---

### Principle 11: Dependency Currency

**Rule:** Direct dependencies should track current major versions. Minor/patch drift is acceptable; lagging a major version is not.

**Audit Strategy:**
- Compare installed major versions against current stable releases for key dependencies
- Flag any dependency more than one major version behind

**Severity:** MEDIUM - stale major versions accumulate migration debt and miss security fixes

---

## Cross-Cutting Design Guidelines

These apply across all principles when evaluating architectural decisions:

1. **Implicit correction masks upstream failures** — Reject invalid input rather than fixing it. Examples: silent type conversion, default values for required fields, translation layers that never reject, retry loops that swallow errors.

2. **Functions that accept all inputs without rejection are fallbacks, not validators** — If a "validator" or "normalizer" never raises an error, it's hiding problems.

3. **System-derived values belong in code, not external input** — Values determined by workflow state (status, IDs, counts) should be set by the system that owns them, not expected from external sources.

4. **No backward compatibility** — Flag any code containing these keywords as violations: `legacy`, `deprecated`, `backward`, `compat`, `migration shim`, `old format`, `previous version`, `for compatibility`. Dead code should be deleted, not preserved with comments explaining why it exists.

---

## Audit Workflow

1. **Launch parallel subagents** for each principle
2. **Consolidate findings** by principle and severity
3. **Cross-reference:** Ensure findings are categorized by the principle they violate, not just where discovered
4. **Suggest new principle** (optional) - see below
5. **Write report** to `temp/audit-arch/arch_audit_{YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS}.md`
6. **Output summary** to terminal

---

## Principle Suggestion (Optional)

After consolidating findings, consider whether a **new** architectural principle would significantly benefit the codebase.

**Criteria - ALL must be true:**
- Not a one-off issue
- No existing principle covers it
- Would prevent recurring architectural debt or bugs
- Impact would be HIGH or CRITICAL level

**If criteria met:** Add "Suggested Principle" section to report with:
- One-sentence rule statement
- 2-3 specific locations that motivated it

**If criteria NOT met:** Omit section entirely. Do not suggest principles just to have a suggestion.

---

## Exclusions

Do NOT flag:
- Test files
- Re-export shims (thin wrappers only)
- Project config reads (package.json, build configs)
- External tool output (test runner output, build logs)

---

## Severity Guidelines

**CRITICAL:**
- Reading state from secondary sources instead of authoritative source
- Circular dependencies between domains
- External interface contract violations

**HIGH:**
- Lower layers importing from higher layers
- Cross-domain imports at same layer
- Duplicate implementations
- Manual field selection causing silent data loss

**MEDIUM:**
- Code in wrong domain
- Inconsistent patterns
- Deferred imports indicating debt
- Stale major version dependencies

**LOW:**
- Naming inconsistencies
- Empty directories not cleaned up
