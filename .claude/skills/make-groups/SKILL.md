# Implementation Group Decomposition Skill

Break a large document — architecture proposal, feature spec, migration plan, or requirements set — into self-contained implementation groups ordered for sequential execution through the make-plan pipeline.

## When to Use

- User says "make groups", "group requirements", "sequence groups", "decompose into groups"
- User has a large document with many requirements/features that must be implemented incrementally
- User wants to feed groups one at a time through `/make-plan`

## Core Principles

- **Groups are implementation units, not categories.** Each group must be independently plannable and implementable. A group produces a working, testable increment.
- **Requirements travel with their group.** Every requirement from the source document must appear in exactly one group, referenced by its original ID. No requirement is dropped or split.
- **Dependency order is the sequencing rule.** Group A's output is available when Group B starts. Order by what produces foundations first, consumers last.
- **Source material is unverified input.** Verify claims about the codebase against subagent findings before incorporating them into grouping decisions.

## Critical Constraints

**NEVER:**
- Modify any source code files
- Create files outside `temp/make-groups/` directory
- Drop, split, or rewrite requirements — reference them by original ID
- Create groups that cannot be independently planned
- Include implementation steps or technical approach in the group descriptions

**ALWAYS:**
- Use subagents to verify codebase structure before finalizing groups
- Include every requirement from the source document in exactly one group
- Assign each group a sequential suffix: groupA, groupB, ... groupZ
- State dependencies between groups explicitly
- Write to `temp/make-groups/` directory

## Workflow

### Step 1: Read the Source Document

Read the full document. Inventory every requirement (REQ-*), feature, and deliverable. Build a raw list with original IDs preserved.

### Step 2: Verify Against Codebase

Launch **parallel Explore subagents** to understand:

- What exists today that the requirements relate to
- Module boundaries and dependency directions
- Which components are foundational vs. consumers

### Step 3: Form Groups

Cluster requirements into groups. Each group must:

1. Be independently plannable — someone could take this group to `/make-plan` without needing other groups implemented first (except declared dependencies)
2. Produce a working increment — after implementation, the system is in a valid state
3. Contain all related requirements — no requirement is orphaned or deferred

Name each group with a short descriptive label and assign suffix groupA through groupZ in implementation order.

### Step 4: Order by Dependency

Sort groups so that each group's dependencies are satisfied by earlier groups. Document the dependency chain explicitly.

### Step 5: Write the Groups Document

Save to: `temp/make-groups/groups_{topic}_{YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS}.md`

```markdown
# Implementation Groups: {Topic}

**Date:** {YYYY-MM-DD}
**Source:** {Document path or description}
**Groups:** {count}

## Dependency Chain

{group_id} → {group_id} → ... (linear or DAG as needed)

---

## {Group Label} (groupA)

### Purpose
{What this group delivers and why it comes at this position in the sequence}

### Dependencies
{None, or list of group IDs that must be complete first}

### Requirements
- **REQ-XXX-001:** {Original requirement text}
- **REQ-XXX-002:** {Original requirement text}
- ...

### Planning Context
{What make-plan needs to know: affected modules, key interfaces, constraints. Factual only — no prescribed approach.}

---

## {Group Label} (groupB)

{Same structure}

---

{Repeat for each group}

## Traceability

| Requirement | Group |
|-------------|-------|
| REQ-XXX-001 | groupA |
| REQ-XXX-002 | groupA |
| REQ-YYY-001 | groupB |
| ... | ... |
```

### Step 6: Verify Completeness

Before finalizing, check:

- Every requirement from the source document appears in the traceability table
- No requirement appears in more than one group
- No group depends on a group that comes after it in the sequence
- Each group is self-contained enough to be a `/make-plan` input

Report the summary to terminal.
